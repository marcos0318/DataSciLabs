# DataSciLabs

This repo contains small pieces of code in data science&machine learning. The labs are in a jupyter notebook file and the machine learning code are in separate folders

1, MOOC projects from andrew ng in matlab 

* ex1: linear regression with gradient descent
* ex2: logistic regression of classifying & regularization
* ex3: Neural Network and multiclass classification
* ex4: Neural Network Learning
* ex5: Regularization on Linear Regression
* ex6: SVM and a little bit kernel
* ex7: Clustering, K-means and PCA

2, Mat245, Mathematics in Data Science via University of Toronto, lab materials, In python

* lab1: basic numpy and ploting
* lab2: SVD and lower rank approx of an image
* lab4: Conditioning and Numerical Stability
* lab5: Linear Regression via Gradient Descent, Normal Equation, and QR factorization
* lab6: Linear Regresson via Pseudo Innverse 
* lab7: Distributions, and large number theorms
* lab8: Curse of Dimensionality, volunm of a hypercube, and Random Projection Algorothm
* lab9: Logistic Regression, PCA and KNN

3, the code rewrite the code from coursera in python (to be finished after the final exams :(

(partly done in another repo called ml_exercise)
